                        <h3>Black Heritage Future Leaders 2024</h3>

                    <main>
                        <p>Have you heard of Black Heritage Future Leaders (BHFL) by Bright Network? Hosted yearly, BHFL is an event where students of black heritage can attend and hear from senior leaders who can help navigate having a career as a black professional. This is especially important as it is good to hear form those who are in their respective fields, and hear any advise they have. One reason why I applied was due to the opportunity to network with fellow black students / graduates on the Guild platform and LinkedIn. Furthermore, It is great to hear about diversity and inclusion programmes and hear what companies are doing to be inclusive from the perspective of employers.</p>
                        <p> Also, after the event, you earn a certificate which looks great on your CV! Interested? Click on the link below! </p>

Furthermore, there is the opportunity for attendees to ask questions.
                            Keynote speakers - They provide exclusive wisdom on to excel in their chosen fields and advise on how to step into underrepresented fields.

                            Opportunities - This includes the opportunity to connect with sponsor firms and market stall companies. these companies can offer bespoke opportunities to attendees.</p>

                    <main>
                        <p>The "10,000 Black Interns" initiative is a UK-based program aimed at increasing the number of Black interns in various industries. Launched in 2020, it addresses the lack of diversity in the professional workforce by providing internships and work experience opportunities specifically for Black students and recent graduates.</p>
                        <p>The program is designed to help bridge the gap between education and employment by offering meaningful, paid internship placements across a range of sectors, including finance, law, engineering, and media. By partnering with numerous companies and organizations, the initiative seeks to create pathways for Black individuals to enter and succeed in different fields, while also fostering greater inclusion and representation within these industries.</p>
                        <p>In addition to internships, the program often includes support such as mentorship, networking opportunities, and career development workshops, aiming to equip participants with the skills and connections needed to advance their careers. The ultimate goal is to not only provide valuable work experience but also to challenge and change the systemic barriers that contribute to underrepresentation of Black professionals in the workforce.</p>
